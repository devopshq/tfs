Development
===========

Development takes place on GitHub, where the git-flow branch structure is used:

* ``master`` - contains the latest released code
* ``develop`` - is used for development of the next release. **Pull request must be in this branch**
* ``feature/XXX`` - feature branches are used for development of new features
    before they are merged to ``develop``

Tests
=====

We use HTTPPrety.
For GET-response locate you response.json to folder by URL. E.g:

* http://tfs.tfs.ru/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/wit/workitems?ids=anyid&anyflag
    => **tests/resources/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/wit/workitems/response.json**
* http://tfs.tfs.ru/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/tfvc/changesets/10/workItems
    => **tests/resources/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/tfvc/changesets/10/workItems/response.json**
